//In JavaScript one of the primitive types is boolean.
//A boolean is a value that is either true or false.
//Additionally, every other value in JavaScript is either truthy or falsy.
//This means that although the value is not true or false explicitly the value can be considered as truthy or falsy.

//It is easier to recall the falsy values because there are fewer of these. 
//Any value which is not falsy is truthy. The falsy values in JavaScript are as follows:

// False
// 0
// "" (Empty string)
// NaN
// Null
// Undefined
